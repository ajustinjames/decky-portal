# AI Code Policy

> **Effective Date:** February 2026
> **Last Reviewed:** February 2026
> **Applies to:** All contributors to the Decky Portal project

---

## Purpose

This policy establishes clear guidelines for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the development of Decky Portal. It ensures transparency, maintains code quality, and sets expectations around accountability and asset creation.

---

## Scope

This policy covers:

- AI-assisted code generation (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, or similar tools).
- AI-assisted code review suggestions.
- AI-generated documentation or text content.
- AI-generated visual assets, audio, branding, or other creative media.

## Code: AI-Assisted Generation Permitted Under Strict Review

### Policy

AI-generated or AI-assisted code **may be used** in this project, provided that **every line of AI-generated code has been reviewed and approved** before it is merged into any branch.

### Requirements

1. **Human review is mandatory.** No AI-generated code may be committed, pushed, or merged without explicit review and approval.

2. **The submitter is accountable.** The submitter takes full responsibility for the correctness, security, performance, and maintainability of the code — exactly as if they had written it themselves.

3. **AI output is a starting point, not a final product.** Reviewers must:
   - Verify that the code is correct and handles edge cases.
   - Confirm that it follows the project's coding standards and conventions.
   - Ensure it does not introduce security vulnerabilities, data leaks, or privacy violations.
   - Check that it does not contain copyrighted code, licence-incompatible snippets, or proprietary content.
   - Validate that it integrates correctly with the existing codebase.

4. **AI tools must not be given access to secrets.** API keys, credentials, tokens, and other sensitive data must never be pasted into AI prompts or AI-connected editors that transmit data to external services.

## Assets: No AI-Generated Creative Media

### Policy

**No visual assets, audio, branding, icons, illustrations, or other creative media in this project may be generated by AI.**

### Rationale

- AI-generated art raises unresolved legal and ethical questions regarding copyright, training data consent, and artist attribution.
- The project values supporting human creators and maintaining clear provenance for all visual and creative assets.
- This avoids potential licence contamination where the legal status of an AI-generated asset is ambiguous.

### What This Means in Practice

- Icons, logos, illustrations, screenshots, and promotional images must be created by human designers or sourced from properly licenced asset libraries.
- Stock assets must have clear, compatible licences (e.g., CC0, MIT, or a purchased commercial licence).
- If a contributor is unsure whether an asset was AI-generated, it should not be used until its provenance is confirmed.

---

## Documentation & Text

- AI-assisted drafting of documentation, comments, and commit messages is **permitted** under the same review standards as code.
- A human must review all AI-generated text for accuracy, tone, and completeness before it is merged.
- AI-generated text must not misrepresent facts, fabricate references, or include hallucinated information.

---

## Compliance

- This policy applies to all contributors: maintainers, collaborators, and community members submitting pull requests.
- Pull requests that appear to contain unreviewed AI-generated code may be flagged and returned for proper review.
- Repeated violations may result in revoked commit access at the maintainers' discretion.

---

## Review & Updates

This policy will be reviewed at least once per year, or whenever significant changes in AI tooling or legal landscape warrant an update. Suggestions for changes can be submitted as issues or pull requests against this document.
