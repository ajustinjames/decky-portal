# Product Vision

## Summary

**Portal** transforms a basic picture-in-picture web viewer into a reliable, touch-friendly web companion for the Steam Deck. Users should be able to watch streams, browse video sites, and interact with web content without ever leaving their game.

---

## Why "Portal"?

The original plugin was named *Picture in Picture* and focused narrowly on floating a webpage over gameplay. The rebrand to **Portal** reflects a broader ambition: the plugin is a *portal* from your game into the wider web — bookmarks, media controls, authentication, and a polished windowing experience included.

## Who Is This For?

| Persona           | Need                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Casual Viewer** | Watches YouTube or Twitch while playing low-intensity games. Wants one-tap access to favourite channels. |
| **Binge Watcher** | Streams Netflix / Disney+ during grinding sessions. Needs reliable sign-in and fullscreen video.         |
| **Multitasker**   | Keeps a guide, wiki, or chat open alongside gameplay. Needs flexible window sizing and positioning.      |
| **Tinkerer**      | Explores lesser-known sites or self-hosted services. Values bookmarks and easy URL entry.                |

## Guiding Principles

1. **Touch-centric** — Every interaction is designed for the touchscreen. Controller and gamepad input are not a design target for this plugin.
2. **Non-intrusive** — The plugin should never interfere with gameplay. Minimise, close, or hide must always be one tap away.
3. **Fast to launch** — From the Quick Access Menu to content playing should take no more than two taps.
4. **Respect the user's data** — Credentials and browsing data stay on the device. No telemetry, no cloud sync.
5. **Incremental polish** — Ship each feature in a usable state. Iterate based on user feedback.

## Success Metrics (Qualitative)

Because this is a community plugin without analytics, success is measured by:

- Positive user feedback on the Decky store and GitHub issues.
- Reduction in reported pain points from the original plugin.
- Feature requests shifting from "basics" to "nice-to-haves."
